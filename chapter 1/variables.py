# Variables are used to store the data and its values

# Rules for Python variables:
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
# A variable name cannot start with a number.
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

a=20
print(a)
name="prasanna"
print(name)
age=30
print(age)
